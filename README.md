## Project Summary

This project demonstrates the application of **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** using Power BI to derive actionable insights into customer purchasing behavior from Adventure Works retail sales data. The objective was to segment customers for targeted marketing strategies that drive retention, engagement, and revenue growth.

- **Star Schema Data Modeling** — Optimized data structure for analytics  
- **RFM Scoring** — Customer segmentation based on purchasing recency, frequency, and monetary value  
- **Design Thinking Framework** — Structured problem-solving approach for business insights  

## Methodology
